# Web-Scraping-in-Python

Web Scraping (also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting, etc.) is a technique for extracting large amounts of data from websites  and save the the extracted data to a local file or to a database.

In this repository, you will find two applications that I have created to gain hands on experience on web scrapping.

- Historical Exchange Rate Convertor - Built an exchange rate convertor which takes date, base currency symbol, desired currency symbol and quantity as input and returns the converted currency amount on the date using Foreign exchange rates API

- Rotten Tomato Action list Scrapper - Fetched Rank, title, year, tMeterScore, adjusted_score, critics_consensus, synopsis, synopsis_link, director, cast for 140 essential action movies to watch right now curated by Rotten Tomatos
